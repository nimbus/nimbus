# Neovex

The role of this file is to capture common mistakes and recurring confusion points for agents working in this repo.

If you hit a surprise that is likely to trip up another agent, tell the developer. Ask before adding a brief principle-first note here. If the guidance needs more than a few bullets, it probably belongs in `docs/*.md` or beside the code instead of here.

## Keep This File Small

- Put durable repo-wide rules, repeated traps, and verification commands here.
- Add new entries only with developer approval.
- Prefer principle-first notes over historical bug writeups.
- Link to canonical docs for architecture details instead of copying them here.
- Do not use this file as a changelog, ownership map, or deep implementation manual.

## Pre-Launch Status

**This project has NOT launched yet.** There are no production users or data to migrate.

- **Breaking changes are preferred.** Choose clean replacements over compatibility layers.
- **No backwards compatibility code.** Delete old behavior instead of deprecating it.
- **No migration shims.** Change the schema or API directly.
- **No feature flags for legacy behavior.** Remove the old path entirely.

If you find yourself writing compatibility code, stop and make the breaking change instead.

## Canonical References

### Project docs

Use the repo docs for architecture and behavior details:

- `README.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Workspace layout

The repo is a Rust workspace + npm monorepo. Names overlap — know which you mean:

| Name | Path | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `neovex` (facade crate) | `crates/neovex/` | Re-exports public types for embedders |
| `neovex-bin` | `crates/neovex-bin/` | CLI binary entry point |
| `neovex-core` | `crates/neovex-core/` | Shared types and validation (zero I/O) |
| `neovex-engine` | `crates/neovex-engine/` | Central coordinator (`Service`) |
| `neovex-runtime` | `crates/neovex-runtime/` | V8 execution (zero workspace deps) |
| `neovex-server` | `crates/neovex-server/` | HTTP/WebSocket transport |
| `neovex-storage` | `crates/neovex-storage/` | Persistence layer (redb) |
| `neovex-test-support` | `crates/neovex-test-support/` | Shared test fixtures |
| `neovex` (JS SDK) | `packages/neovex/` | Neovex-native JavaScript SDK |
| `convex` (JS compat) | `packages/convex/` | Convex compatibility package |
| `@neovex/codegen` | `packages/codegen/` | Code generation tool |

## Common Repo Gotchas

### Crate dependency rules

These are architecture invariants — do not violate them:

- **`neovex-core` has zero I/O.** Types and validation only. No file reads, no network calls.
- **`neovex-runtime` has zero workspace dependencies.** It defines the V8 surface and `HostBridge` trait. All Neovex-specific integration lives in the server's bridge implementation.

### Mutation path

Every mutation — HTTP, WebSocket, scheduler, or V8 runtime — flows through `Service::apply_mutation`. There is no separate code path. Do not create one.

### Storage atomicity

Document write + index update + commit log append are a single redb transaction. Never commit a document without its index entries. Never append a commit without the document write.

### Runtime bundles

Runtime bundles are SHA-256 integrity-checked before every invocation. Runtime host operations (`ctx.db.insert(...)` etc.) go through the same `Service` path as direct HTTP calls — no bypass.

### Schema is optional

A table without a schema accepts any document. Setting a schema adds constraints but never removes the ability to write.

### JavaScript package naming

`packages/neovex` is the JS SDK. `crates/neovex` is the Rust facade. When discussing "neovex" clarify which.

## Verification Commands

- **Format check:** `cargo fmt --all --check`
- **Full test suite:** `cargo test --workspace`
- **Lint:** `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- **Dependency audit:** `cargo deny check`
- **JS tests:** `npm run test --workspaces --if-present`
- **JS build:** `npm run build --workspaces --if-present`
- **All at once:** `make ci`

Run `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` before opening a PR. CI enforces both plus `cargo deny check`.
